                <h2>hi! I'm Wence</h2>
                <p>I'm a Dreamer looking for new ways to learn and create.
                    </p>
                <p>As a healthcare professional , I have dedicated the last six 
                    years training and educating those in need through physical 
                    rehabilitation to help them recover and maintain their 
                    quality of life.
                    </p>
                <p>Having a penchant for teaching had made it's way into my 
                    favorite pastime, where I share my passion for the art of 
                    Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.
                    </p>
                <p>I recently started a crash course in web development/programming 
                    and I know that this process will be one of the most difficult 
                    projects I will undertake. I couldn't be more excited! This 
                    space is, and will be, a work in progress . Having said that, 
                    a 'comments' section is not ready yet. In the meantime, I can 
                    be reached here for comments, advice, or just to say 'hi' back. 
                    Hope to year from you!
